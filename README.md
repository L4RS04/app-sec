# BingeVault

BingeVault is an application that lets users create and manage personalised watchlists of series and movies, either for themselves or for others. Users can create multiple watchlists to track what they’ve watched before, plan what they would like to watch in the future or create a watchlist with recommendations for others. Users will also have the ability to leave ratings on the movies and series they’ve watched.
